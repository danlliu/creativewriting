                <h3>Documentation:</h3>
                <p>creative writing is a stack-based ISA where common words are used as part of instructions. You
                    are highly encouraged, although it is not necessary, to write your programs as short stories :)</p>
                <h4>Registers</h4>
                <p>creative writing has 8 registers, which can be accessed using the following <b>register words</b>:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>r0: <samp>am</samp> or <samp>I'm</samp></li>
                    <li>r1: <samp>be</samp>
                    <li>r2: <samp>are</samp>, <samp>you're</samp>, <samp>we're</samp>, or <samp>they're</samp></li>
                    <li>r3: <samp>is</samp>, <samp>he's</samp>, <samp>she's</samp>, or <samp>it's</samp></li>
                    <li>r4: <samp>was</samp>
                    <li>r5: <samp>were</samp>
                    <li>r6: <samp>being</samp>
                    <li>r7: <samp>been</samp>
                </ul>
                <h4>Stack Manipulation:</h4>
                <p>there are six core operations to the stack in creative writing:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><samp>took...[reg]</samp> or <samp>take...[reg]</samp>: stores the top of the stack to the
                        specified register and pops the top of the stack. if a register word is not directly
                        after <samp>took</samp> or <samp>take</samp>, as is common, all words in between will be
                        ignored until a register word is encountered</li>
                    <li><samp>gave...[reg]</samp> or <samp>give...[reg]</samp>: pushes the value in the specified
                        register to the stack. if a register word is not directly after <samp>gave</samp> or
                        <samp>give</samp>, as is common, all words in between will be ignored until a register word
                        is encountered</li>
                    <li><samp>use</samp>, <samp>using</samp>, or <samp>used</samp>: pops a value off the stack.
                        this value is gone forever!</li>
                    <li><samp>none</samp>: pushes 0 to the stack</li>
                    <li><samp>after [word]</samp>: pushes the number of characters in the word immediately
                        following the <samp>after</samp> keyword to the stack. for example,
                        <code>after foo</code> pushes the value <code>3</code> to the stack</li>
                    <li><samp>like</samp>: gets the value from the top of the stack and pushes it again onto the
                        stack.</li>
                </ul>
                <h4>Stack Operations:</h4>
                <p>there are a wide variety of stack operations that can be performed on the values in the stack:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><samp>these</samp>: pops two elements from the stack, adds them, and pushes the sum onto
                        the stack</li>
                    <li><samp>no</samp>: pops an element from the stack, negates it (to its additive inverse), and
                        pushes it to the stack</li>
                    <li><samp>all</samp>: pops two elements from the stack, takes their bitwise AND, and pushes the
                    result onto the stack</li>
                    <li><samp>any</samp>: pops two elements from the stack, takes their bitwise OR, and pushes the
                        result onto the stack</li>
                    <li><samp>not</samp>: pops two elements from the stack, takes their bitwise complement, and
                        pushes the result onto the stack</li>
                    <li><samp>must</samp>: pops two elements from the stack, and pushes the larger of the two onto
                        the stack</li>
                </ul>
                <h4>Control Flow:</h4>
                <p>creative writing uses the beginning of each paragraph as a branch location. start a new paragraph
                by putting a newline into the text. the following control flow statements are available:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><samp>go</samp>: jumps to the paragraph number on the top of the stack, and pops the stack</li>
                    <li><samp>go back</samp>: stores the next paragraph number into register 7 (<samp>been</samp>),
                        jumps to the paragraph number on the top of the stack, and pops the stack</li>
                    <li><samp>if...go</samp>: conditional branch. the target address is initially at the top of the
                    stack. after popping the target address, if the top two elements are equal, then branch to the
                        target paragraph. three elements are popped from the stack during this instruction (target
                        address and two elements to compare)</li>
                    <li><samp>if...go back</samp>: conditional branch. performs the same actions as
                        <samp>if...go</samp>, but also stores the next paragraph number into register 7
                        (<samp>been</samp>)</li>
                </ul>
                <h4>Other Keywords:</h4>
                <p>creative writing also has other keywords that make the generation of true writing more manageable.
                    the keywords <code>to</code> and <code>the</code> marks the next keyword encountered as unused.
                    when <code>the</code> is found after the keyword <code>after</code> (e.g. <code>after
                        the</code>), the <code>the</code> is ignored and the word after <code>the</code> is used in
                    the letter count for <code>after</code>.
